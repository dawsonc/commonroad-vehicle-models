# Vehicle Models of CommonRoad

This repository contains all vehicle models of the [CommonRoad benchmarks](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/). 

We provide implementation examples in MATLAB and Python, routines to convert initial states and parameters, simulation examples to demonstrate the advantages of more complicated models, and a detailed documentation.
